===========================Redis bulk key/value tester======================================

This application will not work unless there is a running instance of Redis on your machine.

To begin an instance of Redis, simply open terminal/command line and input the command:
	"redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf"
	
Once this is running and there is an active connection, open a new terminal/command line 
window and type the command:
	"redis-cli" 
to launch the Redis command line interface.

To see if the keys are present in Redis, type the command:
	"KEYS *"
in your redis-cli window.
